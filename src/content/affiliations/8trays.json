  "description": "Gang linked to the Crips (resource 3/5, aggressivity 2/5). They deal weed, hash, and a bit of heroin. The 8trays have political claims and values: black culture, formed by the Black Panthers, their thing is the reconquest of black culture from white society. Solstice Studio is their mouthpiece for black activist artists. As a result, the 8trays are not appreciated by other black gangs, not even other Crips. They are known for moralizing.",
